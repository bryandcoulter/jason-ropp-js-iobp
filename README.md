# Banno Onboarding Project

Questions for Collin:

Importing webcomponents, where and how.


## Description

This app allows you to create and edit user profiles, each of which have an ID, Name, Number, and Email Address.

To create a new user, click the 'Create User' tab and fill out the form. Users will be added to the local storage database. 

## how to use

Not currently compatible with firefox

### NPM Scripts
    To serve the app (also runs ux-lint):

        `$ yarn start` then open https://localhost:1820 in the browser.

        This lints, builds, and serves the project

    To see a list of available scripts [or a single script]: 
    
        `$ yarn run help [filter scripts]`

    To lint (UX-Lint)

        `$ yarn lint`

    To build a local example of the bundled file structure that webpack-dev-server uses

        `$ yarn build`


## dependencies

### Local Storage

  The app database uses your browsers local storage. Clearing your browsers cache will delete that database of users.

### @Banno/Polymer

### Webpack-Dev-Server

  Webpack-dev-server wraps around webpack, bundling and serving the files. 

  The bundling and serving happens together on `$ yarn start`

  #### To Build File Structure Locally

  You will not see the bundled folder locally when using webpack-dev-server. 

  If you want to bundle the files locally to see how they will be organized in webpack-dev-server, run `$ yarn build` which fires `webpack` and builds the file locally. 
  
  To view the bundled files from the server:

  `localhost:1820/localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server` in your browser.
  

  ##### Notes

  The locally built files are not the exact files that are served. This is just an example of the file organization that webpack-dev-server builds on the server.

### UX-Lint

  Banno's lint packages for linting files. The .editorconfig file is set up to match Banno's styleguide

### Yarn 
  
  Used for running scripts instead of npm
